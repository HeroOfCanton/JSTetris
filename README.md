# JSTetris

The game is complete, except for bonus features like sound, or fancy modifiers. We implemented all of the pieces, they rotate completely, and you can clear up to 4 lines at a time. When lines are cleared, the remaining blocks fall to take the place of what was there before. There is a significant bug that has not been fixed yet; if you clear two or more lines that are not ajacent to each other, perhaps line 1 and 3, the game will crash. We have a fix, but haven't deployed it.
